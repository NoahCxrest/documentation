description: "Bearer token authentication for all API endpoints"
---

All API requests require authentication via Bearer token in the Authorization header.

---

## Bearer Token Authentication

Every request to the Melonly API must include a valid Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer your_api_token_here
```

Tokens are server-scoped and inherit the permissions of the user who created them.

<Warning>
**Token Security:** API tokens provide full access to your server data. Store them securely and never expose them in client-side code or version control.
</Warning>

  <Tab title="Go">
    ```go

    req.Header.Set("Authorization", "Bearer your_api_token_here")
    
    client := &http.Client{}
    resp, err := client.Do(req)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Token Context

When using your server token, there's no need to include server IDs in request paths. The API automatically infers server context from your token.

<CodeGroup>
```http Correct Usage
GET /api/v1/server/logs
Authorization: Bearer your_server_token
```

```http Unnecessary (but valid)
GET /api/v1/server/12345/logs  
Authorization: Bearer your_server_token
```
</CodeGroup>

All endpoints under `/server/*` automatically operate within your token's server scope.

---

## Rate Limiting

<Info>
Rate limits are enforced per server token for premium users. Review the [rate limiting documentation](/rate-limits) for specific limits and best practices.
</Info>

Authentication failures and rate limit violations are tracked separately. Multiple authentication failures may result in temporary token suspension.

## Authentication Errors

Common authentication error responses:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized - Missing Token">
    **Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "error": "authorization header is required"
    }
    ```
    
    **Cause:** No `Authorization` header provided in the request.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized - Invalid Token">
    **Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "error": "invalid or expired token"
    }
    ```
    
    **Causes:**
    - Token has expired
    - Token was revoked or deleted
    - Malformed token string
    - Token doesn't exist
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="403 Forbidden - Insufficient Permissions">
    **Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "error": "insufficient permissions for this operation"
    }
    ```
    
    **Cause:** Token lacks required permissions for the requested endpoint or operation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
